Thank you for uploading/sending your student list. I've uploaded your master roster and created student accounts.

Your admin account information has been sent to XXXXX in a separate e-mail. From your admin account you will be able to manage student and teacher accounts, and monitor student performance.

You can access [ORG NAME's] sign-in page at XXXX. Your custom sign-in page allows for simple and personalized access to IXL for administrators, teachers, and students. I recommend bookmarking this page for your students!

Teacher Accounts and Class Rosters
The next step is to create teacher accounts and class rosters in one of the following three ways.
    - The quickest and most convenient way to create teacher accounts is to upload your student list with an additional column for the teacher e-mail along with a list of your teachers with their first name, last name, and e-mail address. As soon as you upload it, our system will create teacher accounts and assign students to class rosters for you. You may refer to the Upload Roster Quick-start Guide (https://www.ixl.com/userguides/IXLQuickStart_UploadRoster.pdf) for guidance with the process.
    - You can create teacher accounts yourself from the "Teachers" page in your admin account. Once their accounts are created, each teacher will receive an e-mail with steps to access their accounts and set up their class rosters.
    - You can instruct teachers to create their own accounts by sharing the attached activation instructions with them. Once their accounts are created, teachers can follow the instructions found in our Teacher Quick-start Guide (https://www.ixl.com/userguides/IXLQuickStart_SiteRoster.pdf) to set up their class rosters.

Teachers who have trial accounts should follow the attached instructions under the heading, "If you already have a trial account," to ensure that their trial is successfully merged into your new subscription.

;1.10 Reactivation
::x110::
(
Thanks for reaching out.

I apologize for this. IXL has an automated process that occurs two weeks prior to the first day of school that is listed in the system for a subscription. The process promotes all students up a grade level and clears teachers rosters to get ready for the new year. We send out automated e-mails warning about the process to the primary administrator (cc'ed here), but we need to be notified if it is to be deactivated.

Your school's subscription has the first day of school listed as DATE, so the promotion and roster clearing occurred DATE.

I have reversed the promotion of the students, reactivated the dropped students, restored teacher rosters, and deactivated the process from occurring again this school year. All student progress and credentials are intact.

Again, I apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this has caused. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.

    3. In the "Last name" field, begin to type in the student's last name

Thank you for requesting assistance.

I noticed that you are having some difficulties completing your upload. This is due to the fact that your spreadsheet does not contain student ID numbers. In order to upload your student list, you will need a unique student ID assigned to each student. We ask for student IDs so that our system can uniquely identify each student account on your license to prevent duplicate accounts. Do you have any type of unique identifier such as a school assigned student number of a lunch pin/library card number?

Please upload an updated list, including an ID number and our system will then be able to process it.

;6.05 Auto Rostering
::x605::
(
*attach IXL-Auto-Rostering-Specifications-available on HUB*

My name is NAME, my role is to assist you in setting up your account, which includes help with rostering and unique username/password combinations.

There are two ways you can upload your roster data to IXL.

The first way is to upload and edit roster files manually through the "Upload Roster” section of your IXL portal which will allow you to create teacher and student rosters.  Choosing to upload the files yourself allows you to have full control of adding or removing teachers and students at your discretion. If you have any trouble please click the "Work With An Account Specialist” button to transfer the file to me securely and I will be happy to assist you.
The following is a link to our manual rostering specifications, which details the format the files need your data to be in:

https://www.ixl.com/userguides/IXLQuickStart_UploadRoster.pdf

The second way to upload roster data is through IXL's Auto-Rostering feature. This feature allows you to sync data from your school or district SIS into your IXL account through an SFTP connection. This effectively allows you to manage your IXL students, teachers, and classes centrally from your SIS. Once the Auto-Roster feature is enabled, you will no longer be able to manage students and teachers manually through the IXL website. All changes are provided through your school or district SIS file transfer, which will be uploaded nightly through our Auto-Roster sync.

The following is a link to our Auto-Rostering Technical Specifications, which details the format we need your data to be in:

https://www.ixl.com/help_docs/IXL-Auto-Rostering-Specifications.pdf

Alternatively, IXL supports the OneRoster v1.1 CSV standard. We only use a subset of the data, but we accept the standard set of files as described in the OneRoster specification, with no special additions or modifications needed.

Please note that we do not integrate with Clever for SSO or student rostering, so we are unable to accept files directly from Clever.

Please let me know which method is right for your account and I will be happy to provide more information.
)

;6.06 SSO - What is it?
::x606::
(
Thank you for reaching out!

Yes, we currently offer SSO with Google accounts. We also offer auto-rostering services.

Let me know if you are interested in learning more about our SSO with Google or auto-rostering services.
)

;6.07 Clever Integration
::x607::
(
Thank you for reaching out!

Although we are not currently partnering with Clever to offer rostering or login services, we are happy to work with you to set up auto-rostering directly with IXL and offer SSO from Google accounts.

Let me know if you are interested in learning more about our auto-rostering capabilities or SSO with Google.
)

;6.08 Clever SSO
::x608::
(
Thank you for reaching out!
Although we are not currently partnering with Clever, they have created a way to allow for single sign-on with IXL. If you have any questions or would like more information regarding the feature and how it works, you will need to connect with a Clever representative directly.

Please let me know if there is anything else that I may do for you!

;6.09 Creating Custom Domain
::x609::
(
Thank you for reaching out!

If you'd like more flexibility in assigning specific usernames to students, we can create a personal sign-in page for your school. Your custom page will allow for simple and personalized access to IXL for administrators, teachers, and students. It will look similar to this sample link: www.ixl.com/signin/demo.

Let me know if you'd like to use a custom sign-in page, and I'll be happy to create it for you.

;6.10 Update Admin (Non-Admin)

Thank you for reaching out!

We currently have XXX (cc'ed) listed as your school's primary contact and admin and XXX (cc'ed) listed as the secondary contact. To list you as the admin, I'll just need confirmation from either of these folks, and they're welcome to simply reply to this email. If they are no longer with your school, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

;6.11 Teacher Account Request

(
Thank you for reaching out.

Your IXL admin (cc'ed) is welcome to create an account for you through the admin account by going to the Teachers page under the Account management tab and clicking "Add new teacher" at the top of the page. Alternatively, I'll be happy to create an account for you as soon as I receive authorization from your admin. They are welcome to send me a quick email or phone call to confirm.

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to help.

;6.12 Changing Editions
::x612::
(
Thank you for reaching out. Since questions differ according to country edition on topics such as currency and measurement, after switching editions you and your students will no longer have access to the practice results that your students have completed in the US edition.

Would you like me to move forward with this change? I look forward to hearing from you.
)

;6.13 What Students e-mails are for
::x613::
(
This is a great question.

Providing a student or parent email address allows for parents and students to receive their child's progress reports, as well as retrieve student sign-in information if needed while practicing from home.

;----------------------------------- MERGES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;7.01 Initial Merge Bulk/Trial to site
::x701::
(
*INCLUDE BOTH ADMIN AND TEACHER IN E-MAIL*

I understand you would like to transfer the student data from your TRIAL ACCOUNT/CLASSROOM SUBSCRIPTION to the school's IXL subscription.

Since school subscriptions are set up a little differently than TRIAL ACCOUNT/CLASSROOM SUBSCRIPTION, we'll need to upload a student list to ensure that the students are set up properly. Once I upload your list, we can begin the transfer process.

To get started, please submit a complete student list with the following student information in separate columns of an Excel spreadsheet:

     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - Student ID
     - Grade
     - Teacher Name
     - Teacher E-mail

When ready, you can submit this information through the secure file upload tool by logging in to your admin account and clicking "Upload Roster Files" within the "Account Management" tab.

The last two teacher columns will allow me to add students to their class rosters.

Please note the usernames and passwords will change, but these can be edited at any time. Additionally, if students already have accounts within the school subscription, their data will be overwritten.

[ADMIN], please confirm that this merge is approved.

Let me know if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Again, please note that usernames and passwords will change, but these can be edited at any time. Additionally, if students already had accounts within the school subscription, their data will be overwritten.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

;7.03 Classroom Merge Confirmation
::x703::
(
I have merged [TEACHER NAME]'s classroom subscription into your school subscription. You'll notice  that usernames and passwords were updated to match the school-wide format, and all practice data has been transferred.

If the students' first and last names on the classroom roster did not match those on your master roster, their accounts were left inactive on the teacher's roster. To reactivate them, [TEACHER NAME] can log in to [HIS/HER] IXL account, go to the Students page and click "Activate" at the bottom left of the student list.

Otherwise, students are all set up and may begin practicing right away!

Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.
)

;7.04 Site to Site Merge Confirmation
::x704::
(
I have successfully merged the [ORIGINAL ACCOUNT] school subscription into the [NEW ACCOUNT] subscription. All student accounts should be available there immediately.

Your new admin account has been created on the [NEW ACCOUNT] subscription as well. Please check your e-mail for your account confirmation.
